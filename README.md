# LFA MovieApp Project

This MovieApp is part of training at LFA!
To complete this App I learnt React, components, useEffect, useContext. 

In this App, you will be able to access a range of movies in the Shows page. In the Search Shows page, you will be able to filter movies with a keyword, you can further filter movies by ratings and language.
